# Convert address to map coordinates with Geopy and Pandas
Here you can find a toy example of geocoding with [geopy](https://github.com/geopy/geopy) and [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) libraries.

All steps for this toy examples are collected in the ipython notebook [**data.gouv.fr - pharma.ipynb**](https://github.com/marsbroshok/geocoding-pandas-geopy/blob/master/data.gouv.fr%20-%20pharma.ipynb). 

Address data to play with is a French Open Goverment data with information about [pharmacies](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/carte-des-pharmacies-de-paris-idf/) of the Parisian region.

## Installation
To run notebook on your machine you can:
* `git clone` it to your machine
* download as zip and unpack to your machine
* after that in the terminal go to the unpacked dir and run `ipython notebook`

## Requirements
All code was tested with the following environment:
* Python 2.7.11 (from Anaconda 2.3.0 (x86_64) )
* Jupyter notebook server 4.0.6
* Pandas 0.16.2
